# Blackhole hosts file
#
# This can be used to add additional hosts to blackhole, by
# mapping each entry to a 0.0.0.0 address. The file can be reloaded
# dynamicall by sending dnsmasq a # SIGHUP message, such as:
# `killall -HUP dnsmasq` or `kill -HUP $(pgrep dnsmasq)`

#0.0.0.0	ignoreme.example.com
